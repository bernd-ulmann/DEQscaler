# DEQscaler
Solving differential equations or systems of such equations on an 
analog-electronic analog computer (or a fixed point digital computer or
digital differential analyser) requires these equations to be scaled so that
no variable and no sum ever exceeds the intervall [-1,1] (with -1 and 1 
denoting the "machine units" of the analog computer).
